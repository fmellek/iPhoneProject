    <h1>iPhone</h1>
    <p>iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that presently powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. It is the second most popular mobile operating system globally after Android. iPad tablets are also the second most popular, by sales, against Android since 2013.
Originally unveiled in 2007 for the iPhone, iOS has been extended to support other Apple devices such as the iPod Touch (September 2007) and the iPad (January 2010). As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contains more than 2.2 million iOS applications, 1 million of which are native for iPads. These mobile apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times.

    <h4><strong>HISTORY</strong></h4>
    <p>In 2005, when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone, he had a choice to either "shrink the Mac, which would be an epic feat of engineering, or enlarge the iPod". Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams, led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell, respectively, against each other in an internal competition, with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as a platform for third-party developers: using a well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating a software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps, as well as an App Store within iTunes.</p>
    <h4><strong>ACCESSIBILITY</strong></h4>
    <p>IOS offers various accessibility features to help users with vision and hearing disabilities. One major feature, VoiceOver, provides a voice reading information on the screen, including contextual buttons, icons, links and other user interface elements, and allows the user to navigate the operating system through gestures. Any apps with default controls and developed with a UIKit framework gets VoiceOver functionality built in. One example includes holding up the iPhone to take a photo, with VoiceOver describing the photo scenery.</p>
    
    <h4><strong>MULTITASKING</strong></h4>
    <p>
        1.Background audio  application continues to run in the background as long as it is playing audio or video content.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.Voice over IP  application is suspended when a phone call is not in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
        3.Background location  application is notified of location changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        4.Push notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        5.Local notifications  application schedules local notifications to be delivered at a predetermined time.
    </p>
    <p>
        6.Task completion  application asks the system for extra time to complete a given task.
    </p>
    <p>
        7.Fast app switching  application does not execute any code and may be removed from memory at any time.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>SIRI</strong></h4>
    <p>Siri is a personal assistant and knowledge navigator which works as an application on supported devices. The service, directed by the user's spoken commands, can do a variety of different tasks, such as call or text someone, open an app, search the web, lookup sports information, find directions or locations, and answer general knowledge questions ( "How many cups are in a gallon?").</p>

    <h4><strong>DEVELOPMENT</strong></h4>
    <p>Authorized third-party native applications are available through Apple's App Store for devices running iPhone OS 2.0 and higher. Native apps must be written in Swift or Objective-C (with some elements optionally in C or C++) and compiled specifically for iOS and the 64-bit ARM architecture or previous 32-bit one (typically using Xcode). </p>
    <h4><strong>JAILBREAKING</strong></h4>
    <p>Since its initial release, iOS has been subject to a variety of different hacks centered around adding functionality not allowed by Apple.
      Prior to the 2008 debut of Apple's native iOS App Store, the primary motive for jailbreaking was to bypass Apple's purchase mechanism for installing the App Store's native applications. Apple claimed that it will not release iOS software updates designed specifically to break these tools (other than applications that perform SIM unlocking); however, with each subsequent iOS update, previously un-patched jailbreak exploits are usually patched.</p>
